  <h1 class="title">Future Vision</h1>

  <div class="vision-section">
    <p>
      I believe in having a clear vision of where I want to be. It helps guide my actions today and gives meaning to my goals. My future vision isn't just about success, it's about living a purposeful and impactful life.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>
      I see myself living a peaceful life with the people I love, my family and my future family. I want to live in a comfortable home, stay healthy, and remain grounded in faith. I hope to grow not only in skills but also in character, becoming someone who is kind, generous, and fulfilled.
    </p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      Professionally, I want to grow into an IT expert who builds real-world solutions. Whether it’s creating systems, running a company, or working with a passionate team, I want my work to make life easier for others. I see myself constantly learning and staying curious in a fast-changing tech world.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      My vision is not just about what I achieve, but also about what I give. I want to inspire people who come from simple backgrounds like mine, proving that with effort and faith, they can rise. I want to help my community, support my loved ones, and most importantly, share the gospel with people. I believe in using my life and my story as a way to reflect God’s love and faithfullness.
